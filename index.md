### Hello!

I am a PhD student in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. I work with Dr. Lara Rangel in the Neural Crossroads Laboratory, where we investigate the emergence and evolution of neural oscillations (brain rhythms!!!) in the rodent hippocampus during associative learning.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pdrivier/pdrivier.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
