### Hello!

I am a PhD student in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. I work with Dr. Lara Rangel in the Neural Crossroads Laboratory, where we investigate the emergence and evolution of neural oscillations (brain rhythms!!!) in the rodent hippocampus during associative learning.
