### Hello!

I am a PhD student in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. I work with Dr. Lara Rangel in the Neural Crossroads Laboratory, where we investigate the emergence and evolution of neural oscillations (brain rhythms!!!) in the rodent hippocampus during associative learning.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pdrivier/pdrivier.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
