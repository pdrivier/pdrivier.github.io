### Hello!

I am a PhD student in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. I work with Dr. Lara Rangel in the Neural Crossroads Laboratory, where we investigate the emergence and evolution of neural oscillations in the rodent hippocampus during associative learning, and we develop statistical modeling approaches to chart the trajectory of neuronal spiking with respect to these oscillations.
