I was a post-doc working with Brad Voytek and Ben Bergen in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. Throughout my research career, I have always been interested in how neural circuits adapt to variance and patterns of regularity in the world around us. In my graduate work, I explored this question in the context of the rodent hippocampus, asking how inhibitory interneurons varied their spike timing as a function of changes to an environment's "reward landscape". More recently, I have pivoted my research efforts towards the study of learning in artificial neural networks, with a focus on transformer-based language models and how they vary their weights over the course of pre-training.
