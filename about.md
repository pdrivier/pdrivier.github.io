I was a post-doc working with Brad Voytek and Ben Bergen in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. Throughout my research career, I have always been interested in how the process of learning to interact with the world around us shapes our neural circuitry. In my graduate work, I explored this question in the context of the rodent hippocampus, asking how inhibitory interneurons varied their spike timing as a function of changes to the landscape of rewards in an environment. More recently, I have pivoted my research efforts into the study of artificial neural networks, with a focus on how transformer-based language models vary their weights over the course of pre-training.
