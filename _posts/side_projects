I really enjoy working with a variety of open-source datasets to answer questions about neural organization. 

Aging brings about changes to the various neuron types in the brain. Different brain regions, each with their unique combination of cell types and connectivity patterns, might experience aging differently, however. So for a course project, a group of friends and I set out to ask: are there differences in the progression of gene expression changes in hippocampus and striatum? 

Here's the [paper]( documenting our analysis of the AGEMAP dataset (Zahn et al. 2007) to address this question.
